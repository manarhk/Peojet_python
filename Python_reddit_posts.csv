Python and Selenium are better for scraping data,preetisw,z7qs7y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/z7qs7y/python_and_selenium_are_better_for_scraping_data/,35," Headless browsers in Python and Selenium are better for scraping data from web pages where scrapers have been blocked. 

We followed step-by-step advice for scraping data from a web page using a headless chrome in Selenium Python. It's fast, easy, requires less resources (so it can run on older laptops), and can deal with JavaScript perfectly.

A smart way to print :),Lonely_Comfortable36,uvqz4t,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/uvqz4t/a_smart_way_to_print/,72,"Hello Pythonistas!

I made this print statement alternative in python which is very helpful for debugging. The idea is to save writing a long comment for the variable name every time we want to print something.

`from smartprint import smartprint as sprint`

`veryLongVariableName = 25`

`sprint (veryLongVariableName)`

&#x200B;

Output:

`veryLongVariableName = 25`

&#x200B;

It works through extracting the line of code from the call stack, so works with all kinds of objects and variable number of parameters, just like print. Please let me know your suggestions and if you found the `smartprint` useful :)

&#x200B;

`a = [1,22,31]` 

`sprint (a, len(a))` 

`sprint (np.random.rand())`

Output: 

`a, len(a) : [1, 22, 31] 3` 

`np.random.rand() : 0.649617730484109`

"Is it just me, or is SQLAlchemy an unholy mess?",syllogism_,aqare,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/aqare/is_it_just_me_or_is_sqlalchemy_an_unholy_mess/,75,"I decided to use SQLAlchemy for a relatively simple project, because I don't do much with database connectivity or SQL and thought I ought to learn it, as it seems to be highly regarded. I either don't understand it at all, or it doesn't make a lot of sense.

My main complaint is that the ORM part seems to live in a totally different universe from the SQL query part. If I use a declarative map, and take advantage of the way the ORM allows me to specify relations as table properties etc, how do I then go and use the query language?

It looks to me like there are two totally separate ways to write queries: one using session.query using the ORM, and one using sqlalchemy.sql.select. It just doesn't make any sense to me --- the different parts don't hang together. There are just all these loose ends dangling everywhere, leaving me with multiple ways to do the same thing.

Why we choose FastAPI over Flask for building ML applications,sweetaskate,ravkys,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ravkys/why_we_choose_fastapi_over_flask_for_building_ml/,33,"Hi guys, our team has recently decided to adopt FastAPI and this is our experience:

The project-Milvus Bootcamp is where people can use Milvus, a vector database, to build and experience vector similarity search applications like reverse image search systems and chatbots. Before making the final decision, we researched several mainstream frameworks including Django, Flask, Tornado, and FastAPI. And since our priority is to choose the one that’s most lightweight and agile, we narrowed it down to Flask and FastAPI.

Here are some comparisons we made between FastAPI and Flask:

https://preview.redd.it/qyj684e6a3481.png?width=912&format=png&auto=webp&s=f11832878d811e7b3a6b7d89e744c511a7ced9e1

While there are no silver bullets, we choose FastAPI because of several reasons listed below:

**1. Performance**

Most of the projects in Milvus Bootcamp are built around reverse image search systems, QA chatbots, text search engines, which all have high demands for real-time data processing. Accordingly, we need a framework with outstanding performance, which is exactly a highlight of FastAPI. 

**2. Efficiency**

Milvus Bootcamp is positioned as a type of training resource. This means that the code and components we use must be intuitive and highly efficient. In this regard, we chose FastAPI to improve system efficiency and enhance user experience.

**3. Asynchronous framework**

In the demos we made, one can upload datasets and will be immediately prompted ""request received"". And when the data is uploaded to the demo system, you will receive another prompt ""data upload successfully"". This is an asynchronous process that requires a framework that supports this feature. FastAPI is itself an asynchronous framework, that's why we changed the framework from Flask to FastAPI.

**4. Automatic interactive documents**

Most of our users just want to quickly get started with the server-side development part of the projects in Milvus Bootcamp without writing additional code to create an interface. By providing an OpenAPI document, FastAPI can save one the trouble of testing or debugging APIs and collaborating with front-end teams to develop a user interface. 

If you are interested, there are more details provided in this [article](https://milvus.io/blog/2021-12-03-why-to-choose-fastapi-over-flask.md?page=1#all).",2021-12-07 09:47:39

&#x200B;

Wrote my first lines of Python April 17, 2020. Been a long fun journey. Been through the tutorial hell, nearly quit in September. Mostly, felt like I was building other people's things.

But found a real passion for graph theory, Dijkstra, etc. I was unsatisfied with small textbook graphs. The theory's hard enough -- I wanted to work from intuitive graphs. To be able to custom-build graphs where nodes stand for things in my world -- cities on a map, buildings in a city.

A bit of 'method of loci' in all that, I think.

It's not hard to fill a knapsack with made-up items. But if you have an idea of 'loci' in your mind -- or steps in a project -- it's hard to turn that into an adjacency matrix. Automating that was my goal.

Still very much in development. But it does... something now, so sharing.

My goal is to make it a standalone teaching tool, with layers for colourful, step-by-step search algo's, topological sorting, exportable matrixes/lists, and pre-loaded graphs that correspond to popular locations -- cities, rooms in a building, steps to achieve something.

Anyway, welcome feedback.

Introducing Panther - A Fast and Friendly Python Web Framework,Conclusion-Striking,1568gde,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1568gde/introducing_panther_a_fast_and_friendly_python/,17,"Hey everyone!

I'm excited to introduce Panther, a Python web framework that's designed to be fast and easy to use. With Panther, you can build async APIs quickly and efficiently, without sacrificing performance or readability.

Panther comes with a host of features that make it easy to build robust APIs, including:

- Document-oriented database support (including PantherDB and MongoDB)
- Visual API monitoring in the terminal
- Caching for APIs (both in-memory and in Redis)
- Built-in authentication and permission classes (customizable)
- Custom middleware support
- Custom throttling support

Getting started with Panther is easy - just create a virtual environment, activate it, and install the framework using pip. Then, you can create a new project using the `panther create` command, and start building your API right away.

Here's a quick example of what a Panther API might look like:

```
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

from panther.app import API
from panther.configs import config
from panther import version, status
from panther.request import Request
from panther.response import Response
from panther.throttling import Throttling


@API()
async def hello_world():
    return {'detail': 'Hello World'}


@API(cache=True, throttling=Throttling(rate=5, duration=timedelta(minutes=1)))
async def info(request: Request):
    data = {
        'version': version(),
        'datetime_now': datetime.now().isoformat(),
        'user_agent': request.headers.user_agent,
        'db_engine': config['db_engine'],
    }
    return Response(data=data, status_code=status.HTTP_202_ACCEPTED)
```

If you're interested in learning more about Panther, check out the documentation at https://pantherpy.github.io, or head over to the GitHub repository at [https://github.com/alirn76/panther. ↗](https://github.com/alirn76/panther.)

I made a command-line-interface for PyPI as a 14 year old,wasimaster,q8rrx7,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/q8rrx7/i_made_a_commandlineinterface_for_pypi_as_a_14/,31,"## Introduction

So I've just finished making [pypi-command-line](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/ ""Documentation"")

## Links

**Documentation**: <https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/>  
GitHub: <https://github.com/wasi-master/pypi-command-line>  
PyPI: <https://pypi.org/project/pypi-command-line>

## Some background

*I'm a 14 year old coder* that started programming in python around one and a half years ago. Since then I've learned a lot of other languages too. My biggest project so far would be my discord bot which has around 15k lines of code and on which I spent thousands of hours on, all open source. Lately, I've been trying out other projects and PyPI-command-line is one of them. One day I was making something with a library that I was not familiar with, I had to keep switching between chrome and vscode (or I could have like made them side by side but that takes away a large chunk of space for vscode). So I thought what if there was a library that implemented the PyPI API that I could use to be more productive? So I started searching, and not so long after I found two libraries both of which have only one (ish) working command. So I thought to myself what if I make my own library? Then I started this and after around 3 months here we are now.

I tried to make it as fast as possible even if it means making the code look ugly, but after a few days I realized that this is gonna be really hard to maintain and will have other issues, but I was too busy with school (my final exams are near) so I didn't care about it and went on. Fast forward a couple of months and now my code is the shittiest code I've ever seen, So apologies for that. 

This also taught me that python is very slow. The code has a 1400 ms (1.4s) overhead for starting up and after that everything works extremely fast. I think that overhead is caused by python interpreting that huge shitty code and trying to make sense of that. I've recently thought about moving them to multiple files and then loading only the file necessary for the current command but I think I'll just rewrite all this in [Go](https://golang.org) using [Cobra](https://github.com/spf13/cobra)

## Installation, Usage, Demo, Features

All can be found in the [documentation](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/)

- [Usage and Demo](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/usage)

This list is not exhaustive. For more cool commands see [the docs](https://wasi-master.github.io/pypi-command-line/usage). I highly suggest you to check the docs since there are a lot more cool stuff that isn't mentioned here

## Note

Are people abusing Python?,relickus,11wye72,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/11wye72/are_people_abusing_python/,45,"I learned Python after coming from the C/C++ and Java world. With the massive increase in popularity of Python in the last 10 years, seeing the way it developed, it seems to me like it gained a lot of functionality, which comes natural in other languages, but feels a bit odd in Python.

To be more specific - albeit Python being dynamically typed, people developed countless tools to check or validate or even enforce types in compile or run time (mypy, pyre, pydantic, pyduck etc.). It feels like it goes against the nature of its loose typing.

Another example are decorators. This pattern is noticably overused by many tools adding functionality, but even the language itself - defining a \`class\`,\`static\` and \`abstract\` methods with decorators seems just weird and unnatural. Same thing with function overloading.  Anecdotally, it feels like comparing German to English. German has a special word for every peculiar thing and native support for word generation by concatenation of multiple words whilst in English you have to add some common words together and hope this combination doesnt already exist. And if it does, so what, people will get it from the context.

Lastly, slightly off-topic but relevant point is that it is not even a simple language in my opinion. It has a very flat learning curve initially but the complexity is just further down the road. Im talking about metaclasses,data descriptors, coroutines, magic methods etc. Some languages are difficult right away (C++, Rust etc.), but Python is a intricate misfit dressed as a simpleton.

Am I misunderstanding a philosophical path of the language or is it simply just a scripting langugage that got massively popular through chance and is now used for stuff it was not intended for?

Can we stop overvaluing PEP-8?,Unknown Author,ddq2y,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/ddq2y/can_we_stop_overvaluing_pep8/,54,"If we're going to be giving out negative marks for projects not following [PEP-8](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/), we might as well give Reddit negative marks for not following [XHTML 1.0 Transitional](http://validator.w3.org/check?uri=www.reddit.com&charset=\(detect+automatically\)&doctype=Inline&group=0) standards. Oh snap...

This is nothing new, but it's kind of ridiculous to still see comments like ""this would be better if it followed PEP-8"" or ""I don't get why people don't follow the standard"" (made up comments, but close enough to what I've seen).

***
The first sentence of PEP-8 states, with added emphasis...
> This document gives coding conventions **for the Python code comprising the standard library in the main Python distribution**.

That means exactly what it says. It is not intended to be some language-wide standard that everyone must follow in every project that uses Python under the sun. There is no canonical C++ coding standard that all C++ ever written has to follow. C# isn't bound by law to be written the same by everyone around the world. Perl...well, nevermind.

Personally, I think PEP-8 is quite a fine standard, one I *choose* to use in my personal work, and one I'm bound by for the work I do within Python itself (additionally, see [PEP-7](http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0007/)). If someone wants to make the next great web framework use ALL CAPS, go right ahead, it'll probably still be cool.

***
The second section of PEP-8 states, again with added emphasis...
> Consistency with this style guide is important.  Consistency *within a project* is **more important**. Consistency *within one module or function* is **most important**.

Remember those projects ""not following PEP-8""? Well, PEP-8 still loves them. The stdlib's own [unittest](http://svn.python.org/view/python/branches/py3k/Lib/unittest/case.py?view=markup) package is fine by PEP-8, although many would have you believe otherwise. The API is very widely used and changing it to more strictly follow PEP-8 would be damaging, but its consistency over the lifetime of the package (previously just a module) gives it a thumbs up.

***
Right after that, PEP-8 states...
> But most importantly: know when to be inconsistent -- sometimes the style guide just doesn't apply.

I've read comments stating that [pywin32](http://sourceforge.net/projects/pywin32/) and [wmi](http://timgolden.me.uk/python/wmi/index.html) would be better if they followed PEP-8. For a second, lets forget a previous statement that it's a standard for the internals of Python and not a global standard. If we open it up to be a global standard, those packages are wrappers of Win32 functionality, and as such, should be as close as possible to direct mirrors of the Win32 APIs they cover. Changing WaitForSingleObject to wait\_for\_single\_object gains absolutely nothing. In fact, it becomes less useful, because tracking down the documentation for the underlying call becomes more difficult, among other things.

***
So, can we please give up the ""PEP-8 or die!"" mentality? If you want to follow the standard, great, high-five to you. If you want to name your classes with lower case and use camel case method names, great, high-five to you as well.",2010-09-14 15:34:56

DIY SaaS with Python & Streamlit,InterestingBasil,1910de9,https://www.reddit.com/r/Python/comments/1910de9/diy_saas_with_python_streamlit/,11,"I've been trying to turn my data science scripts into a full-blown SaaS, and I wanted to share my process and some helpful tidbits. I recently dove into building a SaaS web app using Python, Streamlit, MongoDB, and Stripe. Here's a distilled version [of the guide that got me started](https://medium.com/gitconnected/build-a-data-science-saas-app-with-just-python-a-streamlit-guide-240e0a56fc86) and my experience so far.

**Getting Started with Streamlit and Python:**

Streamlit is a godsend for Python developers who want to create web apps without the frontend hassle. It lets you focus on the Python stuff while taking care of the UI elements. Start by installing Streamlit and exploring its functionalities with simple apps.

**Building the Core Features:**

Here's what you'll be piecing together:

**User Authentication with MongoDB:** This is your first step into making your app secure and personalized. Start by setting up a MongoDB cluster (Atlas is a good start). You'll need to handle user registration, login, and session management. Python's 'pymongo' library will be your bridge to interact with MongoDB.

**Email Verification:** A crucial step for validating users. You'll typically use a third-party service to send emails and then update the user's status in your database once they confirm.

**Handling Subscriptions with Stripe:** If you plan to monetize your app, integrating a payment system like Stripe is essential. Begin with setting up a Stripe account and then use their API to create subscription plans and handle payments. Python's 'stripe' package will be useful here.

**Data Science Tools with GPT-3.5:** This is where the fun begins. Using OpenAI's GPT-3.5, you'll add features like language translation and text summarization. You'll interact with the OpenAI API and process the data to provide these services.

**Step by Step:**

**Set Up Your Environment:** Make sure Python, pip, and all necessary packages like 'streamlit', 'pymongo', and 'stripe' are installed.

**Layout Your App with Streamlit:** Use Streamlit's widgets to create the user interface. You'll have sections for user registration/login, text input for the GPT-3.5 tools, and subscription management.

**Integrate MongoDB:** Write functions to connect to your MongoDB database for user registration and authentication. You'll store user details and manage sessions here.

**Email Verification Logic:** Set up a method to send verification emails to users and a route in your app to handle the confirmation logic.

**Subscription Management with Stripe:** Use Stripe's API to create and manage subscriptions. You'll need to handle webhook events for subscription updates.

**Incorporate GPT-3.5 Features:** Utilize OpenAI's API to add your data science tools. Ensure you handle the API responses correctly and present the results in your app.

**Testing and Iterating:**

As you build, constantly test each component. Streamlit allows you to see changes in real-time, which is great for tweaking and fixing issues on the go.

**Deployment:**

Once you're happy with your app, you can deploy it using various services. Streamlit sharing is a straightforward option for small-scale apps. For something more robust, look into services like Heroku or AWS.

While I'm understanding the basics, I feel like I need a way to supplement reading tutorials, which is the only way I've been learning so far. Can anyone recommend a website like Codecademy, where I can practice interactively? For some reason, the Python tutorials on Codecademy don't work for me. ",2012-10-01 07:56:51
